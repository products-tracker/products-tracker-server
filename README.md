# Possible API's

## Blog on scraping the Google Shopping data
This API is only good for 100 queries, there's a paywall. We might integrate it but we need something like it that's free. Our instructor 
said this one is pretty much perfect, we just need a free one.

For now we're using fake data from FakeStore API. I've integrated a product search, so we have one route, '/fakestore', that's getting data back. Now I just have to integrate it into the frontend. I'm a bit code loopy now so I've gotta take a break, sorry I didn't get more done on the back end! I should be on about 4:00 pm Germany Time (lol), so we can get some work done together on it.

Here's the FakeStore API.
